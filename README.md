A semester-long project for CS307 Software Engineering

We created a locally playable poker game (like windows game) that allows friends to gather and play Texas Hold'em without having physical chips or a deck of cards.
The reason why we chose this project, even though there are many online poker game platforms out there, is because, as beginners of software engineering, it will challenge us in terms of pure software designing unlike other project topics that are more challenging in terms of learning new language/platform or specific knowledge.
